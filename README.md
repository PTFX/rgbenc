A fun little arduino pro micro based rotary encoder thingie, which connects as a HID mouse and has a scroll wheel and also changes colour.

The HSV->RGB function, which is probably the most interesting thing in this code, was copied (with permission) from bertho's wonderful implementation in [OSAA's IKEA sign](https://github.com/openspaceaarhus/ikea-sign)

The encoder is [from sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10982)
